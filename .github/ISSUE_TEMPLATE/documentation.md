This is for requesting new documentation or corrections/modifications/additions to existing documentation.

If you have a problem without an answer in the [How do I…?](https://awkward-array.org/how-do-i.html) tutorials, ask it here and we will answer it as a new tutorial that will benefit everybody.

If your problem is too specific for that or it isn't exclusively related to Awkward Array, it might be more appropriate to ask on [StackOverflow with the [awkward-array] tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/awkward-array), instead of here. Be sure to include tags for any other libraries that you use, such as Pandas or PyTorch.

Here are some additional links that might help you find what you're looking for. It would be helpful if requests to change existing documentation includes a link.

   * [The tutorials site](https://scikit-hep.org/awkward-1.0/index.html)
   * [The C++ API](https://awkward-array.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/index.html)
   * [The Python API](https://awkward-array.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
