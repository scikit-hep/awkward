    """
    Args:
        array: Data in which to count elements.
        axis (None or int): If None, combine all values from the array into
            a single scalar result; if an int, group by that axis: `0` is the
            outermost, `1` is the first level of nested lists, etc., and
            negative `axis` counts from the innermost: `-1` is the innermost,
            `-2` is the next level up, etc.
        keepdims (bool): If False, this reducer descreases the number of
            dimensions by 1; if True, the reduced values are wrapped in a new
            length-1 dimension so that the result of this operation may be
            broadcasted with the original array.
        mask_identity (bool): If True, reducing over empty lists results in
            None (an option type); otherwise, reducing over empty lists
            results in the operation's identity.

    Counts elements of `array` (many types supported, including all
    Awkward Arrays and Records). The identity of counting is `0` and it is
    usually not masked.

    This function has no analog in NumPy because counting values in a
    rectilinear array would only result in elements of the NumPy array's
    [shape](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.shape.html).

    However, for nested lists of variable dimension and missing values, the
    result of counting is non-trivial. For example, with this `array`,

        ak.Array([[ 0.1,  0.2      ],
                  [None, 10.2, None],
                  None,
                  [20.1, 20.2, 20.3],
                  [30.1, 30.2      ]])

    the result of counting over the innermost dimension is

        >>> ak.count(array, axis=-1)
        <Array [2, 1, None, 3, 2] type='5 * ?int64'>

    the outermost dimension is

        >>> ak.count(array, axis=0)
        <Array [3, 4, 1] type='3 * int64'>

    and all dimensions is

        >>> ak.count(array, axis=None)
        8

    The gaps and None values are not counted, and if a None value occurs at
    a higher axis than the one being counted, it is kept as a placeholder
    so that the outer list length does not change.

    See #ak.sum for a more complete description of nested list and missing
    value (None) handling in reducers.

    Note also that this function is different from #ak.num, which counts
    the number of values at a given depth, maintaining structure: #ak.num
    never counts across different lists the way that reducers do (#ak.num
    is not a reducer; #ak.count is). For the same `array`,

        >>> ak.num(array, axis=0)
        5
        >>> ak.num(array, axis=1)
        <Array [2, 3, None, 3, 2] type='5 * ?int64'>

    If it is desirable to include None values in #ak.count, use #ak.fill_none
    to turn the None values into something that would be counted.

    if all lists at a given dimension have the same length and no None values,
    but it generalizes to cases where they do not.

    For example, consider this `array`, in which all lists at a given dimension
    have the same length.

        ak.Array([[ 0.1,  0.2,  0.3],
                  [10.1, 10.2, 10.3],
                  [20.1, 20.2, 20.3],
                  [30.1, 30.2, 30.3]])

    A sum over `axis=-1` combines the inner lists, leaving one value per
    outer list:

        >>> ak.sum(array, axis=-1)
        <Array [0.6, 30.6, 60.6, 90.6] type='4 * float64'>

    while a sum over `axis=0` combines the outer lists, leaving one value
    per inner list:

        >>> ak.sum(array, axis=0)
        <Array [60.4, 60.8, 61.2] type='3 * float64'>

    Now with some values missing,

        ak.Array([[ 0.1,  0.2      ],
                  [10.1            ],
                  [20.1, 20.2, 20.3],
                  [30.1, 30.2      ]])

    The sum over `axis=-1` results in

        >>> ak.sum(array, axis=-1)
        <Array [0.3, 10.1, 60.6, 60.3] type='4 * float64'>

    and the sum over `axis=0` results in

        >>> ak.sum(array, axis=0)
        <Array [60.4, 50.6, 20.3] type='3 * float64'>

    How we ought to sum over the innermost lists is unambiguous, but for all
    other `axis` values, we must choose whether to align contents to the
    left before summing, to the right before summing, or something else.
    As suggested by the way the text has been aligned, we choose the
    left-alignment convention: the first `axis=0` result is the sum of all
    first elements

        60.4 = 0.1 + 10.1 + 20.1 + 30.1

    the second is the sum of all second elements

        50.6 = 0.2 + 20.2 + 30.2

    and the third is the sum of the only third element

        20.3 = 20.3

    The same is true if the values were None, rather than gaps:

        ak.Array([[ 0.1,  0.2, None],
                  [10.1, None, None],
                  [20.1, 20.2, 20.3],
                  [30.1, 30.2, None]])

        >>> ak.sum(array, axis=-1)
        <Array [0.3, 10.1, 60.6, 60.3] type='4 * float64'>
        >>> ak.sum(array, axis=0)
        <Array [60.4, 50.6, 20.3] type='3 * float64'>

    However, the missing value placeholder, None, allows us to align the
    remaining data differently:

        ak.Array([[None,  0.1,  0.2],
                  [None, None, 10.1],
                  [20.1, 20.2, 20.3],
                  [None, 30.1, 30.2]])

    Now the `axis=-1` result is the same but the `axis=0` result has changed:

        >>> ak.sum(array, axis=-1)
        <Array [0.3, 10.1, 60.6, 60.3] type='4 * float64'>
        >>> ak.sum(array, axis=0)
        <Array [20.1, 50.4, 60.8] type='3 * float64'>

    because

        20.1 = 20.1
        50.4 = 0.1 + 20.2 + 30.1
        60.8 = 0.2 + 10.1 + 20.3 + 30.2

    If, instead of missing numbers, we had missing lists,

        ak.Array([[ 0.1,  0.2,  0.3],
                  None,
                  [20.1, 20.2, 20.3],
                  [30.1, 30.2, 30.3]])

    then the placeholder would pass through the `axis=-1` sum because summing
    over the inner dimension shouldn't change the length of the outer
    dimension.

        >>> ak.sum(array, axis=-1)
        <Array [0.6, None, 60.6, 90.6] type='4 * ?float64'>

    However, the `axis=0` sum loses information about the None value.

        >>> ak.sum(array, axis=0)
        <Array [50.3, 50.6, 50.9] type='3 * float64'>

    which is

        50.3 = 0.1 + (None) + 20.1 + 30.1
        50.6 = 0.2 + (None) + 20.2 + 30.2
        50.9 = 0.3 + (None) + 20.3 + 30.3

    An `axis=0` sum would be reducing that information if it had not been
    None, anyway. If the None values were replaced with `0`, the result for
    `axis=0` would be the same. The result for `axis=-1` would not be the
    same because this None is in the `0` axis, not the axis that `axis=-1`
    sums over.

    The `keepdims` parameter ensures that the number of dimensions does not
    change: scalar results are put into new length-1 dimensions:

        >>> ak.sum(array, axis=-1, keepdims=True)
        <Array [[0.6], None, [60.6], [90.6]] type='4 * option[1 * float64]'>
        >>> ak.sum(array, axis=0, keepdims=True)
        <Array [[50.3, 50.6, 50.9]] type='1 * var * float64'>

    and `axis=None` ignores all None values and adds up everything in the
    array (`keepdims` has no effect).

        >>> ak.sum(array, axis=None)
        151.8

    The `mask_identity`, which has no equivalent in NumPy, inserts None in
    the output wherever a reduction takes place over zero elements. This is
    different from reductions that are otherwise equal to the identity or
    are equal to the identity by cancellation.

        >>> array = ak.Array([[2.2, 2.2], [4.4, -2.2, -2.2], [], [0.0]])
        >>> ak.sum(array, axis=-1)
        <Array [4.4, 0, 0, 0] type='4 * float64'>
        >>> ak.sum(array, axis=-1, mask_identity=True)
        <Array [4.4, 0, None, 0] type='4 * ?float64'>

    The third list is reduced to `0` if `mask_identity=False` because `0` is
    the identity of addition, but it is reduced to None if
    `mask_identity=True`.

        >>> ak.mean(array, axis=-1)

    because there are three lists, the first has mean `1.5`, the second is
    empty, and the third has mean `4.5`.

    The mean of the outermost lists is

        >>> ak.mean(array, axis=0)
        <Array [2, 3, 2, 3] type='4 * ?float64'>

    because the longest list has length 4, the mean of `0` and `4` is `2.0`,

            broadcasted with the original array.

            usually resulting in floating-point `nan`.

    Computes the variance in each group of elements from `x` (many
    types supported, including all Awkward Arrays and Records). The grouping
    is performed the same way as for reducers, though this operation is not a
    reducer and has no identity. It is the same as NumPy's
    [var](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.var.html)
    if all lists at a given dimension have the same length and no None values,
    but it generalizes to cases where they do not.

    Passing all arguments to the reducers, the variance is calculated as

        ak.sum((x - ak.mean(x))**2 * weight) / ak.sum(weight)

    If `ddof` is not zero, the above is further corrected by a factor of

        ak.sum(weight) / (ak.sum(weight) - ddof)

    Even without `ddof`, #ak.var differs from #ak.moment with `n=2` because
    the mean is subtracted from all points before summing their squares.

    See #ak.sum for a complete description of handling nested lists and
    missing values (None) in reducers, and #ak.mean for an example with another
    non-reducer.

    Args:
        x: the data on which to compute the softmax.
        weight: data that can be broadcasted to `x` to give each value a
            weight. Weighting values equally is the same as no weights;
            weighting some values higher increases the significance of those
            values. Weights can be zero or negative.
        axis (None or int): If None, combine all values from the array into
            a single scalar result; if an int, group by that axis: `0` is the
            outermost, `1` is the first level of nested lists, etc., and
            negative `axis` counts from the innermost: `-1` is the innermost,
            `-2` is the next level up, etc.
        keepdims (bool): If False, this function descreases the number of
            dimensions by 1; if True, the output values are wrapped in a new
            length-1 dimension so that the result of this operation may be
            broadcasted with the original array.
        mask_identity (bool): If True, the application of this function on
            empty lists results in None (an option type); otherwise, the
            calculation is followed through with the reducers' identities,
            usually resulting in floating-point `nan`.

    Computes the softmax in each group of elements from `x` (many
    types supported, including all Awkward Arrays and Records). The grouping
    is performed the same way as for reducers, though this operation is not a
    reducer and has no identity.

    This function has no NumPy equivalent.

    Passing all arguments to the reducers, the softmax is calculated as

        np.exp(x) / ak.sum(np.exp(x))

    See #ak.sum for a complete description of handling nested lists and
    missing values (None) in reducers, and #ak.mean for an example with another
    non-reducer.
