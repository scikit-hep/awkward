    Multiplies elements of `array` (many types supported, including all
    Awkward Arrays and Records). The identity of multiplication is `1` and it
    is usually not masked. This operation is the same as NumPy's
    [prod](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.prod.html)
    if all lists at a given dimension have the same length and no None values,
    but it generalizes to cases where they do not.

    See #ak.sum for a more complete description of nested list and missing
    value (None) handling in reducers.
