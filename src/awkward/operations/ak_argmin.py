            broadcasted with the original array.

            None (an option type); otherwise, reducing over empty lists
            results in the operation's identity.

            high-level.

    Returns the index position of the minimum value in each group of elements
    from `array` (many types supported, including all Awkward Arrays and
    Records). The identity of minimization would be infinity, but argmin
    must return the position of the minimum element, which has no value for
    empty lists. Therefore, the identity should be masked: the argmin of
    an empty list is None. If `mask_identity=False`, the result would be `-1`,
    which is distinct from all valid index positions, but care should be taken
    that it is not misinterpreted as "the last element of the list."

    This operation is the same as NumPy's
    [argmin](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.argmin.html)
    if all lists at a given dimension have the same length and no None values,
    but it generalizes to cases where they do not.

    See #ak.sum for a more complete description of nested list and missing
    value (None) handling in reducers.
