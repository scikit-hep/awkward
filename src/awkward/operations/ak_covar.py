    Args:
        x: One coordinate to use in the covariance calculation (anything #ak.to_layout recognizes).
        y: The other coordinate to use in the covariance calculation (anything #ak.to_layout recognizes).
        weight: Data that can be broadcasted to `x` and `y` to give each point
            a weight. Weighting points equally is the same as no weights;
            weighting some points higher increases the significance of those
            points. Weights can be zero or negative.
        axis (None or int): If None, combine all values from the array into
            a single scalar result; if an int, group by that axis: `0` is the
            outermost, `1` is the first level of nested lists, etc., and
            negative `axis` counts from the innermost: `-1` is the innermost,
            `-2` is the next level up, etc.
        keepdims (bool): If False, this function decreases the number of
            dimensions by 1; if True, the output values are wrapped in a new
            length-1 dimension so that the result of this operation may be
            broadcasted with the original array.
        mask_identity (bool): If True, the application of this function on
            empty lists results in None (an option type); otherwise, the
            calculation is followed through with the reducers' identities,
            usually resulting in floating-point `nan`.
        highlevel (bool): If True, return an #ak.Array; otherwise, return
            a low-level #ak.contents.Content subclass.
        behavior (None or dict): Custom #ak.behavior for the output array, if
            high-level.
        attrs (None or dict): Custom attributes for the output array, if
            high-level.

    Computes the covariance of `x` and `y` (many types supported, including
    all Awkward Arrays and Records, must be broadcastable to each other).
    The grouping is performed the same way as for reducers, though this
    operation is not a reducer and has no identity.

    This function has no NumPy equivalent.

    Passing all arguments to the reducers, the covariance is calculated as

        ak.sum((x - ak.mean(x))*(y - ak.mean(y))*weight) / ak.sum(weight)

    See #ak.sum for a complete description of handling nested lists and
    missing values (None) in reducers, and #ak.mean for an example with another
    non-reducer.
