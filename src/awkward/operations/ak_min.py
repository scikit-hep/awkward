        array: Array-like data (anything #ak.to_layout recognizes).
        axis (None or int): If None, combine all values from the array into
            a single scalar result; if an int, group by that axis: `0` is the
            outermost, `1` is the first level of nested lists, etc., and
            negative `axis` counts from the innermost: `-1` is the innermost,
            `-2` is the next level up, etc.
        keepdims (bool): If False, this reducer decreases the number of
            dimensions by 1; if True, the reduced values are wrapped in a new
            length-1 dimension so that the result of this operation may be
            broadcasted with the original array.
        initial (None or number): The maximum value of an output element, as
            an alternative to the numeric type's natural identity (e.g. infinity
            for floating-point types, a maximum integer for integer types).
            If you use `initial`, you might also want `mask_identity=False`.
        mask_identity (bool): If True, reducing over empty lists results in
            None (an option type); otherwise, reducing over empty lists
            results in the operation's identity.
        highlevel (bool): If True, return an #ak.Array; otherwise, return
            a low-level #ak.contents.Content subclass.
        behavior (None or dict): Custom #ak.behavior for the output array, if
            high-level.
        attrs (None or dict): Custom attributes for the output array, if
            high-level.

    Returns the minimum value in each group of elements from `array` (many
    types supported, including all Awkward Arrays and Records). The identity
    of minimization is `inf` if floating-point or the largest integer value
    if applied to integers. This identity is usually masked: the minimum of
    an empty list is None, unless `mask_identity=False`.
    This operation is the same as NumPy's
    [amin](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.amin.html)
    if all lists at a given dimension have the same length and no None values,
    but it generalizes to cases where they do not.

    See #ak.sum for a more complete description of nested list and missing
    value (None) handling in reducers.
