Combinatorics
=============

The user guide is a collection of "how to..." guides for common tasks. See the left side-bar (or bring it into view by clicking on the upper-left `≡`) to access the guides, grouped by topic.

If you're looking for documentation on a specific function, see the API reference instead.

You can test any examples in a new window/tab by clicking on [![Try It! ⭷](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Try%20It%21%20%E2%86%97-orange?style=for-the-badge)](https://awkward-array.org/doc/main/_static/try-it.html).
