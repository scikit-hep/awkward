How to filter arrays: cutting vs. masking
=========================================

**This is a stub:** I intend to write this article, but haven't yet.

If you need it soon, create an issue saying so and I'll make it a higher priority.

[![](../image/github-issues-documentation.png)](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0/issues/new?assignees=&labels=docs&template=documentation.md&title=)

The text of your issue doesn't have to be much more than a link to this page, so I can be sure which page you're referring to. If you add details about how and why you need it, however, I may be able to tailor the text to help you more.
